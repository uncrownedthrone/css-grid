Grid Notes

Grid Container - this is the whole grid area/container
  display: grid - first
  this is the direct parent of all of the grid items

  in this example, "container" is the grid container:

  <div class="container">
    <div class="item item-1"></div>
    <div class="item item-2"></div>
    <div class="item item-3"></div>
  </div>

Grid Item - these are the children of the grid container
  In this exapmle, the "item" class is the child. "sub-item" is not (since it's not a container - p tag)

  <div class="container">
    <div class="item"></div>
    <div class="item">
  	  <p class="sub-item"></p>
    </div>
    <div class="item"></div>
  </div>
